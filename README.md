# Covid-Detection

Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) is emerged in Wuhan, China in 2019. It has spread
throughout the world from the year 2020. Millions of peoples were affected and caused death to
them. To avoid this spreading of COVID-2019 various precautions and restrictions have been
taken by all the nations. At the same time infected persons are need to identified, isolate and
medical treatment should be provided to them. Due to deficient number of Reverse Transcription
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests, Chest Computed tomography (CT) has becomes
effective technique to diagnosis of COVID-19. This work examines the efficiency of multi CNN,
such as VGG 19, Efficient Net and ResNet50 for automatic detection of COVID-19. The
discriminative features from last layer of these architectures were feed as an input to support
vector machine (SVM) and Bayesnet classifiers for the prediction of COVID-19. The different
hyper parameters of the SVM and Bayesnet were optimized using Bayesian optimization
algorithm. The experimental analyses are conducted to identify the performance of proposed
CNN architecture using COVID-19 radiology database. The entire database was separated by
70% training and 30% testing respectively. The dataset consists of 453 COVID-19 images and
497 non-COVID images. VGG 19, Efficient Net and ResNet50 achieved an accuracy of 89 %,
91.16% and 94%. These proposed models can be used to assist radiologists and physicians to
reduce the misdiagnosis rates and to validate the positive COVID -19 infection cases.
